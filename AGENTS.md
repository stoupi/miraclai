Repository Guidelines

Prohibited Practices

• No useEffect: Use fetch in server components via services, or handle side effects via event handlers • No TypeScript any: Always use strong typing (not any or as any) ; if you need custom types, reuse them via @/types/ ; never use ts ignore comments. • No OOP patterns: Avoid classes or object-oriented approaches • No Bad naming: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components, it has to be explicit • No Bad comments: Never use comments to explain the code, it has to be explicit

Required Practices

• Component library: Use shadcn/ui components exclusively • Generic components: Create reusable components in @/components/ui/ when shadcn equivalent doesn't exist • Migration: When you change the database schema (prisma/schema.prisma), you need to create a new migration with prisma migrate dev --name and then run prisma generate to update the prisma client. If you have any problem with the migration, you can run prisma migrate reset to reset the database. • Authentication: use const session = await getTypedSession(); (see lib/auth-helpers.ts) to check auth and redirect if needed ; check user auth in actions with authenticatedAction (see actions/safe-action.ts) • Internationalization: Implement next-intl for French/English translations • Client components: useTranslations hook • Server components: getTranslations function • Error handling: Translate all Zod/API errors in both languages • Self-explanatory code: Avoid unnecessary comments

Architecture & Code Organization

Project Structure

• Feature-based architecture: Use feature folders for each app functionality • Services layer: Write all API/Prisma calls in lib/services/ • Component splitting: Refactor components/pages when > 350 lines • Server-first approach: Fetch data in page.tsx (server-side) and prop drill to client components

Data Management

• Prisma types: Always use types from schema.prisma • Server actions: Use next-safe-action for all mutations • Links with locale: Use Link/useRouter from @/app/i18n/navigation (next-intl navigation). Always pass route keys like /team and let next-intl localize. • Type safety: Strong typing required (no any type) • Global state: Use Zustand stores in lib/stores/ for state shared across distant components • Store structure: Separate state and actions interfaces, use TypeScript strict typing

React/Next.js Patterns

• Server components: Default choice for data fetching and static content • Client components: Only when interactivity is required • Form handling: Use React Hook Form with Zod validation • State management: Prefer server state over client state when possible • Zustand usage: • Use for global state shared between distant components • Create domain-specific stores (user, theme, preferences) • Use selectors to optimize re-renders: const user = useUserStore(state => state.user) • Include devtools middleware for debugging in development

Testing & Debugging

UI Testing & Analysis

• Playwright MCP: Primary tool for testing and debugging UI • Screenshots: Take screenshots as feedback to identify and correct issues • E2E testing: Use Playwright for comprehensive testing

Quality Assurance

Code Review Process

• Automated checking: Always run laser-lewis agent after writing code • Standards verification: Ensure all guidelines are followed before commits • Clean codebase: Maintain high code quality and consistency

Project Overview

Next.js 15 application with modern stack and strict development standards:

Technology Stack

• Next.js 15.3.3 with App Router and Turbopack • TypeScript with strict mode enabled • Tailwind CSS v4 for styling • Better Auth for authentication (email/password and Google OAuth) • Prisma with PostgreSQL for database • React Hook Form with Zod for form validation • Playwright for E2E testing • Shadcn UI for component library • Next-safe-action for server actions • Next-intl for internationalization (French & English) • Zustand for global state management

Development Principle: Write clean, type-safe, maintainable code that follows modern React/Next.js patterns while adhering to strict architectural guidelines.
